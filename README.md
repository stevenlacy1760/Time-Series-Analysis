# Time-Series-Analysis
Homework

The time-series analysis showed that long term wise the value of yen will increase slowly, but shorter term time frames have a higher volality along the way with higher spikes. This sudden short term changes are risky so I would not buy yen right no considering the risk.

The Out-of-Sample model had better results than the In-Sample results, so the Out-of Sample would be the better choice when trying to make future predictions.
